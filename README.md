Among some stunning features SkiaSharp version 3 brought the latest [SKSL syntax](https://skia.org/docs/user/sksl/). 
Can now use [official samples](https://shaders.skia.org/) etc, to create modern shaders to be used in.NET MAUI.

An important new possibility is to port existing GLSL shaders into the modern SKSL, what was done in this case. Adapted GLSL shaders from https://github.com/gl-transitions/gl-transitions were used.

[DrawnUI](https://github.com/taublast/DrawnUi.Maui) preview nuget was used to render on Skia canvas.
