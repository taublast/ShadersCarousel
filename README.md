Among some stunning features SkiaSharp version 3 introduced the latest [SKSL syntax](https://skia.org/docs/user/sksl/).

Now we are can use [official samples](https://shaders.skia.org/) and create modern shaders to be used inside .NET MAUI.

An important possibility is now to port existing GLSL shaders into SKSL , what was done in this case. Adapted GLSL shaders from https://github.com/gl-transitions/gl-transitions where used.
