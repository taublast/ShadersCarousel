__Still working on this, some polishment is to be done, and there's a UI-thread related random crash on Android to be fixed. ETA by the 12-13th of November.__

Among some stunning features SkiaSharp version 3 brought the latest [SKSL syntax](https://skia.org/docs/user/sksl/). 
Can now use [official samples](https://shaders.skia.org/) etc, to create shaders for .NET MAUI.

An important new possibility is to port existing GLSL shaders into the modern SKSL, what was done in this case. Adapted GLSL shaders from https://github.com/gl-transitions/gl-transitions were used.

[DrawnUI](https://github.com/taublast/DrawnUi.Maui) preview nuget was used to render on Skia canvas.
